## Arrays

O(1) constant, but bad at insert/ removing elements O(n) linear

## Linked List

Good at inserting/ removing O(1), bad at accessing by index O(n)

## Hash Table

Table of key/ value pairs; array with hash function; table can have multiple keys to prevent collisions - good for access by key, insert/ remove O(1)

## Stacks and Queues

Like linked lists with limited operations, STACK (last in first out) like stack of plates, QUEUE (first in first out) like queue for admission; can only insert to end of list O(1), removal only first for queue and last for stack

## Graph

|V| vertices or nodes, |E| for edges, can have weights on edges for cost, distance, capacity, etc.

## Tree

Node in tree can only have one incoming edge, like an organizational chart; good for networks, dependency relationships, hierarchies, etc.

## Heap

Max or min always top value O(1), often visualized as trees but implemented as arrays; inserting is O(log n) dependent on height of tree, can only remove top value

Sorting algorithms, merge sort: O (n log n)
