# Two Pointers

**Tracking two places in an array at the same time**

- Linear data structure: The input data can be traversed in a linear fashion, such as an array, linked list, or string.
- Process pairs: Process data elements at two different positions simultaneously.
- Dynamic pointer movement: Both pointers move independently of each other according to certain conditions or criteria. In addition, both pointers might move along the same or two different data structures.

Real world problem: Memory management: The two pointers pattern is vital in memory allocation and deallocation.
