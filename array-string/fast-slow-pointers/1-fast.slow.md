# Fast and Slow Pointers

\*\* Similar to the two pointers pattern, the fast and slow pointers pattern uses two pointers to traverse an iterable data structure, but at different speeds, often to identify patterns, detect cycles, or find specific elements. The speeds of the two pointers can be adjusted according to the problem statement. Unlike the two pointers approach, which is concerned with data values, the fast and slow pointers approach is often used to determine specific pattern or structure in the data.

Real-world problems
Many problems in the real world use the fast and slow pointers pattern. Let’s look at some examples.

- Symlink verification: A symbolic link, or symlink, is simply a shortcut to another file. Essentially, it’s a file that points to another file. Symlinks can easily create loops or cycles where shortcuts point to each other. To avoid such occurrences, a symlink verification utility can be used, and fast and slow pointers are useful in that case.

- Compiling an object-oriented program: Compiling object-oriented programs often involves managing dependencies between various modules stored in separate files for easier maintenance. However, these dependencies can sometimes form cyclic relationships, leading to compilation errors. By employing the fast and slow pointers pattern, these cycles can be detected and resolved, ensuring smooth compilation and execution of the program.
