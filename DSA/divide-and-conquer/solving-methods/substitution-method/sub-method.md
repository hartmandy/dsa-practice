# Substitution Method

To apply the inductive hypothesis, you substitute the guess ed solution for the function on smaller values— hence the name “substitution method .” This method is powerful, but you must guess the form of the answer.

- Guess the form of the solution using symbolic constants.
- Use mathematical induction to show that the solution work s, and ﬁnd the constants.
